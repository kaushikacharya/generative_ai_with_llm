## Responsible AI

- Invited speaker: Dr. Nashlie Sephus

- Special challenges of responsible generative AI
  - Toxicity
  - Hallucinations
  - Intellectual Property

- Responsibly build and use generative AI models
  - Define use cases: the more specfic/narrow, the better
  - Assess risks for each use case
  - Evaluate performance for each use case
  - Iterate over entire AI lifecycle

## Course conclusion

- On-going research
  - Responsible AI
  - Scale models and predict performance
    - [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp)
      - Run LLaMA model using 4-bit integer quantization
  - More efficiencies across model development lifecycle
    - Especially, more efficient techniques for pre-training, finetuning, and reinforcement learning.
  - Increased and emergent LLM capabilities
    - Example: Researchers are looking into developing models that support longer prompts and contexts.
